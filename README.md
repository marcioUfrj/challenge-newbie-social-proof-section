## My process

1. I built the desktop version first.
2. I finished the fist half section with the stars reviews then I finished the bottom half with people's reviews.
3. I adjusted the layout to match the mobile version.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- CSS Position: how to position images according to their parent size.
- CSS Grid: position elements across multiple rows and columns.
- Better understanding of "container"'s size and "children"'s size. I mean, how to size objects to have some dynamic response but it's kind of confusing to me.

### Continued development

- Keep improving on sizing objects in order to have a nice responsive site.

### Useful resources
